# coq-hol-light-logic
WIP Translation of the HOL-Light [Logic library](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/tree/master/Logic) using [hol2dk](https://github.com/Deducteam/hol2dk).

Currently only the mappings are included. 

Currently depending on https://github.com/agontard/coq-hol-light (slightly modified from the official release of [coq-hol-light](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light) for mappings of functions on sets)  
and on https://github.com/agontard/coq-hol-light-real-with-N/tree/list_cleanup (adding tactics to to [coq-hol-light-real-with-N](https://github.com/Deducteam/coq-hol-light-real-with-N) to automatize alignments of inductive types and recursive functions).
